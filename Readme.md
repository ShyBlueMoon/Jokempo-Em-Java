Project: Pedra Papel Tesoura App (Rock Paper Scissors App)
==================================


Introduction
------------

This is a project to demonstrate the concepts I learned on Android development.
This is an app about the classic "rock, paper, scissors" hand game. The user selects one of the three hand shapes available and plays against the app, as it randomly selects also a hand shape option. The winner is shown on the same activity.
